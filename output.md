# Once Upon a Time/Happily Ever After

Once upon a time, in a faraway land...<i><div align='right'>narrator, nanogenmo, distance:0.000, code:input</div></i>

There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.502, code:start</div></i>

It went with me on my sea-shore walks, and rambles into the country, whenever—which was seldom and reluctantly—I bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of Nature, which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that I stepped across the threshold of the Old Manse.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.503, code:start</div></i>

At last, after rambling several days about the country, during which the fields afforded me the same bed and the same food which nature bestows on our savage brothers of the creation, I at length arrived at this place, where the solitude and wildness of the country invited me to fix my abode.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.510, code:start</div></i>

Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.<i><div align='right'>Melville, Herman, Moby Dick; Or, The Whale, distance:0.514, code:start</div></i>

Too long have I lived wildly in wild remoteness, to return to thee without tears!<i><div align='right'>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None, distance:0.515, code:start</div></i>

I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.515, code:start</div></i>

A short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.523, code:start</div></i>

I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, failing there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.530, code:start</div></i>

Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.<i><div align='right'>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None, distance:0.532, code:start</div></i>

But you will not miss me,— You who live between the hills And have never seen the seas.<i><div align='right'>Hughes, Langston, The weary blues, distance:0.534, code:start</div></i>

And out of the midst of superabundance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.<i><div align='right'>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None, distance:0.535, code:start</div></i>

How curious a land is this,—how full of untold story, of tragedy and laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, and big with future promise!<i><div align='right'>Du Bois, W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), The Souls of Black Folk, distance:0.538, code:start</div></i>

The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.539, code:start</div></i>

By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to the sea shore.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.540, code:start</div></i>

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.541, code:start</div></i>

I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

We then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should break.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.410, code:start</div></i>

At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.418, code:start</div></i>

At length we set sail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our ease ten days longer.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.418, code:start</div></i>

One day, when we had been about five weeks at sea, we descried to windward a large ship bearing down upon us with all the sail she could carry.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.423, code:start</div></i>

The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.423, code:start</div></i>

We ran our boat up on the sand, and all sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction returned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us on our voyage.<i><div align='right'>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, Don Quixote, distance:0.424, code:start</div></i>

When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.439, code:start</div></i>

When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.443, code:start</div></i>

It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, distance:0.450, code:start</div></i>

One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.452, code:start</div></i>

When I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.453, code:start</div></i>

So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.340, code:start</div></i>

But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

At last I let go with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.384, code:start</div></i>

I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.388, code:start</div></i>

I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

The tow-head was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.394, code:start</div></i>

2 Then they got up, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that was on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown themselves.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

Then they stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor and get to sea.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.403, code:start</div></i>

At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

When I approached carelessly and alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and instantly took refuge in the depths.<i><div align='right'>Thoreau, Henry David, Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience, distance:0.427, code:start</div></i>

At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.433, code:start</div></i>

I steamed up a bit, then swung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.462, code:start</div></i>

They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no two plunging in the same direction.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete, distance:0.463, code:start</div></i>

The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.<i><div align='right'>Melville, Herman, Moby Dick; Or, The Whale, distance:0.472, code:start</div></i>

They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.<i><div align='right'>Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank), The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, distance:0.473, code:start</div></i>

As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.474, code:start</div></i>

But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.476, code:start</div></i>

I watched the bats darting and turning above the water plants in the fountain basin, but their rapid, jerky flight set my nerves on edge, and I went away again to walk aimlessly to and fro among the trees.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.476, code:start</div></i>

And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He would command them to drink of the water.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.483, code:start</div></i>

And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.316, code:start</div></i>

Then after that, they stood up and prayed that God would accept Abel's offering.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.353, code:start</div></i>

So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.414, code:start</div></i>

2 But he found them standing in the water praying and thought within himself, "Adam and Eve are standing like that in that water praying to God to forgive them their transgression, and to restore them to their former state, and to take them from under my hand.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.417, code:start</div></i>

But their flesh was dried up, and they were weak from fasting and praying, and from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed against God.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.418, code:start</div></i>

And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.419, code:start</div></i>

Adam also went down into the water; and they stood praying; and besought the Lord to forgive them their offense, and to restore them to their former state.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.421, code:start</div></i>

And the angel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.423, code:start</div></i>

There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them, and then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had sent them.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.315, code:start</div></i>

And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.322, code:start</div></i>

And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.345, code:start</div></i>

And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when they were hungry.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.350, code:start</div></i>

And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals: And so he did.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

They went to the altar, where Adam offered it up, as he was accustomed, asking the Lord to accept his offering.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

2 Then God sent to them at once, His angel, who drove away Satan from them.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

2 Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the garden, and told the cherub as God had commanded him.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.397, code:start</div></i>

9 And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they gave all those things to Adam and Eve on the top of the mountain on which Satan had placed them, when he sought to make an end of them.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

5 Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, each to bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam.<i><div align='right'>Platt, Rutherford Hayes, The First Book of Adam and Eve, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

And she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestial chance, had given him back to her.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

The means of procuring her this, he said, he believed was sent him by an angel from heaven.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

Then she went towards him, and might have represented a heaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to a comprehended grief.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.348, code:start</div></i>

Then an angel from heaven came to her and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

He presently lifted her up, and told her he was highly pleased with the extraordinary accident which had sent him thither for her relief, where it was so improbable she should find any; adding, that Heaven seemed to have designed him as the happy instrument of her protection.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

She gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation in the act.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.385, code:start</div></i>

But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.390, code:start</div></i>

Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank heaven, you are back again!<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.391, code:start</div></i>

All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,—this was what filled his brain confusedly.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

For he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature, and that because she came short in her sympathy, he must give the more.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

She hoped that "please God he won't come till I'm gone away," and he suddenly burst in on her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.403, code:start</div></i>

He was bowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone would have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

He had spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness difficult to utter; and yet, now that he had come to the point of going away from her without further speech, he shrank from it as a brutality; he felt checked and stultified in his anger.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.340, code:start</div></i>

But suddenly in the middle of a sentence her eyes filled with tears, her voice failed, she turned away, and bowed down to the church pavement to hide her grief.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.341, code:start</div></i>

Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!" said she, bowing as she saw him out.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.341, code:start</div></i>

Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.349, code:start</div></i>

But the smile disappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:--<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.363, code:start</div></i>

She was trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

She too joined in the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed tears.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.366, code:start</div></i>

All at once she ceased speaking, and this caused him to raise his head mechanically.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

He had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it impelled him to go away without pause.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.374, code:start</div></i>

And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would add:—<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.375, code:start</div></i>

To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,--<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

The emotion had wrought itself more and more into her utterance, till the tones might have gone to one's very marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.311, code:start</div></i>

Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.312, code:start</div></i>

Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.323, code:start</div></i>

She was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.327, code:start</div></i>

Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.333, code:start</div></i>

She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

Her voice, which in point of quality had never been an exceptionally good medium for song, often landed her in difficulties, and in particular she was forced, when singing, to drag the time a little all through.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.337, code:start</div></i>

Hearing him breathe quickly after he had spoken, she sat listening, frightened, wretched—with a dumb inward cry for help to bear this nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by dread.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it very deep.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

She retained that sweetness and symmetry, which death itself could not destroy; and though her discourse was incoherent, her voice was still musical, resembling those feathered songsters who warble their native wood-notes wild.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.341, code:start</div></i>

In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.345, code:start</div></i>

Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.345, code:start</div></i>

It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.346, code:start</div></i>

There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.299, code:start</div></i>

She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.341, code:start</div></i>

What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching murmur which would soon gather distinctness.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.363, code:start</div></i>

She spoke in a soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles Sónya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do, and that in using the superior word "militate" she had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

Her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

She found his discourse remarkably entertaining, his politeness dignified with an air of uncommon sincerity, and she was ravished with his skill in music, an art of which she was deeply enamoured.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.373, code:start</div></i>

Besides, the life and feeling of her passion She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her; When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.373, code:start</div></i>

The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.375, code:start</div></i>

There was something in this lady's air and appearance so distinguished and even imposing, and in her manner so engaging, as to impress one, quite apart from the dignity of her equipage, with a conviction that she was a person of consequence.<i><div align='right'>Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan, Carmilla, distance:0.322, code:start</div></i>

Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she was aiming.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.373, code:start</div></i>

The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.382, code:start</div></i>

She had a sullen furtive manner, lied extravagantly in her assertions of skill and knowledge, and was ever on the alert for slights and possible innuendoes.<i><div align='right'>Mead, Margaret, Coming of age in Samoa : $b A psychological study of primitive youth for western civilisation, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.391, code:start</div></i>

So much more tenderly do women value their reputation than their persons, that, though the latter seemed now in more danger than before, yet, as the former was secure, the lady screamed not with such violence as she had done on the other occasion.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.393, code:start</div></i>

First, for this woman, To justify this worthy nobleman, So vulgarly and personally accused, Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, Till she herself confess it.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

Continually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying, the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

But at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.402, code:start</div></i>

The searching tenderness of her woman's tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

Yet, uttering his long-restrained emotions so vehemently as he did, his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

She did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily, and inquisitively at him.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.310, code:start</div></i>

What could he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was the passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter?<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.315, code:start</div></i>

She held it to be very odious in him that he did not think the painful propositions he had had to make to her were enough, without showing so unpleasant a temper.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.319, code:start</div></i>

He did not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.320, code:start</div></i>

The difference his presence made to her was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly objected to her speech.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.320, code:start</div></i>

She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.321, code:start</div></i>

But there had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which he had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held him in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved not to declare but to carry away into banishment.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.321, code:start</div></i>

She was ready to say that it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless; but those strange particulars of their relation which neither of them could explicitly mention kept her always in dread of saying too much.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.327, code:start</div></i>

Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.336, code:start</div></i>

She was impressed by something about him, and indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.337, code:start</div></i>

Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.342, code:start</div></i>

The immediate occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.348, code:start</div></i>

The fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.355, code:start</div></i>

How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he had waited.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

Her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions, and obeyed blindly.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

Making her feel that she had "wronged" him, he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.384, code:start</div></i>

He exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately confessing the fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly proved against him even by his own wife.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.385, code:start</div></i>

His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.387, code:start</div></i>

The idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

She was heartily sick of him before the end, though she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this "serviceable and magnanimous man."<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse her, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete, distance:0.277, code:start</div></i>

The more blameless he appeared to himself in this examination, the less excusable did her behaviour appear.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.315, code:start</div></i>

His self-blame gave her some hope that he would attend to her opinion, and she said—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.332, code:start</div></i>

His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.374, code:start</div></i>

At other times, when he found her melted into silent sorrow, he affected to excuse the conduct of his friend.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.377, code:start</div></i>

But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except a simple blunder which might happen to anyone.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

Could he be to blame toward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

She was as blind to his inward troubles as he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her husband which claim our pity.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

Certain it is that she hated him very bitterly on that account, and resolved to take every opportunity of injuring him with her mistress.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean backward and rest.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.387, code:start</div></i>

In her need for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own fault.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.391, code:start</div></i>

She, on the other hand, misconstrued his sudden retreat; and now they beheld the actions of each other through the false medium of prejudice and resentment.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

At his first arrival he made no scruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate accident; which he made appear very unfortunate indeed, for he totally extracted every particle of what could be called fault, at least in a court of honour, though he left some circumstances which might be questionable in a court of law.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

He had been subjected to fearful proofs; no violence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her prey and had raged against him.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

I made no scruple to declare, that his wife was unworthy of that tender complaisance which he had shewn for her foibles: that she was dead to all the genuine sentiments of conjugal affection; insensible of her own honour and interest, and seemingly destitute of common sense and reflection.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

He had felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal treasure of his life, and he held himself blameless.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.391, code:start</div></i>

First, his integrity Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himself.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

Nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this accident; the most wanton malice of fortune could not have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow, while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated by his exhibitions.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow's comprehension, or which Providence interpreted after a method of its own.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

Then he bitterly cursed it, as the source of all his misfortunes and affliction.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

Instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution, after the mischief had happened; a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal, the moment that there was no longer any remedy.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.407, code:start</div></i>

He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

Any bitterness that ever existed between us had utterly vanished, and her only complaint was that she could not put me up in her house, instead of my brother Julius, the unfortunate goldsmith, who had none of the qualities that could make him a suitable companion for her.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

That he could not, however, help complaining a little against the peculiar severity of his fate, which brought the news of so great a calamity to him by surprize, and that at a time when he hourly expected the severest blow he was capable of feeling from the malice of fortune.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

His trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have told nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.293, code:start</div></i>

All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

This was a note that effectually roused him from the lethargy of his sorrow; and the desire of taking vengeance on the oppressor, who had ruined his fortune, and made his nearest relations miserable, so entirely engrossed his thoughts, as to leave no room for other considerations.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.356, code:start</div></i>

His heart was sometimes so savaged with despair, which represented mankind as his inveterate enemies, that he entertained thoughts of denouncing war against the whole community, and supplying his own wants with the spoils he should win.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.371, code:start</div></i>

It was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not be scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting even his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity.<i><div align='right'>Stevenson, Robert Louis, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, distance:0.373, code:start</div></i>

He then lamented the follies and vices of which he had been guilty; every one of which, he said, had been attended with such ill consequences, that he should be unpardonable if he did not take warning, and quit those vicious courses for the future.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, A Study in Scarlet, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

His dignified resignation at the impossibility of making his ideals prevail was intended not only to present a true transcript of the arbitrary multifariousness of the things of this world, but also to arouse sympathy for the hero.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

And when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

His guest had been outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.385, code:start</div></i>

He felt that the condition he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

He felt that everything was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this position.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.333, code:start</div></i>

He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.336, code:start</div></i>

Recalling that period long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till the final catastrophe.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.337, code:start</div></i>

Joyed and bewildered with what came, he stood awaiting new wonders till the inevitable Age of Reaction swept over the nation and brought the crisis of to-day.<i><div align='right'>Du Bois, W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), The Souls of Black Folk, distance:0.351, code:start</div></i>

There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.353, code:start</div></i>

His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.357, code:start</div></i>

While he endeavoured to surmount these difficulties, his small reversion was quite exhausted, and he saw himself on the brink of wanting the common necessaries of life.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.358, code:start</div></i>

And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm.<i><div align='right'>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, Don Quixote, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

His soul, however, became impatient and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them.<i><div align='right'>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None, distance:0.363, code:start</div></i>

Thus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there would be no surprises in his visit.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily—he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had continually sought to find—the aim of life—no longer existed for him now.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.238, code:start</div></i>

That search for an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.297, code:start</div></i>

It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.326, code:start</div></i>

And this very absence of an aim gave him the complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.352, code:start</div></i>

He raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.382, code:start</div></i>

There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.393, code:start</div></i>

He felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.394, code:start</div></i>

It was inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so far, how he had managed to remain—why he did not instantly disappear.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had just found it again.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

He snatched the child from her, and then made the men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, she shrieking and struggling the while piteously.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy's head.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.393, code:start</div></i>

He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.400, code:start</div></i>

So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

She had saved a morsel for him to eat, also; but the boy's pains had swept away all appetite--at least for black and tasteless crusts.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

Then he asked his wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink it up.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

She cooked their meals on a coal-oil stove, performing all her little domestic rites carefully and exultingly, and they ate out on the verandah that almost overhung the lake.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.323, code:start</div></i>

So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.385, code:start</div></i>

Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king's castle, so she said to the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on?<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.394, code:start</div></i>

She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.<i><div align='right'>Carroll, Lewis, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

She had done it once already, and the fish was only just going out of the room.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.407, code:start</div></i>

When her husband took his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm—especially before the soup.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.410, code:start</div></i>

As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's use, and placed it beside them.<i><div align='right'>Kafka, Franz, Metamorphosis, distance:0.410, code:start</div></i>

Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in every direction.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.340, code:start</div></i>

Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

She went to bed; and in the morning, after she had escaped the fly and had her breakfast and got out again into the garden, there was this same feeling again, and in broad daylight.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time'; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.390, code:start</div></i>

She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.399, code:start</div></i>

All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited till they came down and out into the garden to her.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.402, code:start</div></i>

In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

When she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight--"a haunt of ancient peace."<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.409, code:start</div></i>

Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.409, code:start</div></i>

She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.356, code:start</div></i>

She turned the bend of the stairs, and the setting sun, shining through the west window a moment on her face, turned her to glory.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

When her light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

The light darting upon my Narcissa's eyes, she awoke also, and recollecting her situation, hid her blushes in my bosom.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.382, code:start</div></i>

But she answered at last, and her light came along the dark passage like a star.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

She, with a bright colour in her lovely face, seemed as one awakened from a dream, and her eyes sought mine with a questioning glance which made me tremble with delight.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.388, code:start</div></i>

But that brave rider was thinking only of escape, and when night and storm indeed settled around her, she awoke as from a pleasant dream.<i><div align='right'>Stephens, Ann S. (Ann Sophia), Esther : $b A story of the Oregon trail, distance:0.391, code:start</div></i>

And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?" she pursued.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.402, code:start</div></i>

She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.403, code:start</div></i>

First her lovely eyes That open entrance show'd me; then at once She vanish'd with thy sleep.<i><div align='right'>Dante Alighieri, The divine comedy, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

Was she aware, I wondered, that we were passing under her window at that moment, and did she know what would await us when we reached our destination?<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

She came to us afterwards; so we heard what she had heard, straight and direct from the source, while we were yet in the excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence; for the event had only occurred the night before.<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.363, code:start</div></i>

We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.375, code:start</div></i>

She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, A Study in Scarlet, distance:0.384, code:start</div></i>

She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

Already, since the houses along the road were becoming numerous, she was conscious that curious eyes were looking at her from every window.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.399, code:start</div></i>

She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.399, code:start</div></i>

She did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman's footsteps running along the path.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.403, code:start</div></i>

She walked along the same avenues and paths by which she had returned from the copse, instinctively remembering the way she had come, gazing before her with her eyes fixed on the ground, looking about intently without answering me, possibly forgetting that I was walking beside her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.407, code:start</div></i>

I got glimpses from time to time through the green foliage of her white dress before me: I followed her mechanically, never losing sight of her, though I trembled at the thought that she might notice me.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.407, code:start</div></i>

Surely for the gaze which had found her, and which she would know again.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.409, code:start</div></i>

She knew from experience that as I was on a money-raising expedition, she would not see me back till late at night.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.414, code:start</div></i>

Then she told me She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew What hour my fit would take me.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.419, code:start</div></i>

She would bring me, along with other news, the result of a certain experiment which I had been starting.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.426, code:start</div></i>

She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send them on some errand.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.431, code:start</div></i>

I saw her eyes taking my measure one evening at the battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained her acquaintance.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.435, code:start</div></i>

To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.440, code:start</div></i>

She did not know whether it was true, she never had thought about it until she met me.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.442, code:start</div></i>

I told her there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than endanger the repose of her ladyship; and, bidding the coachman drive on, wished her a good night.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.442, code:start</div></i>

She was so lost in thought that she did not hear me till I reached her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.446, code:start</div></i>

She brought me to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her again.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.447, code:start</div></i>

Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me, saying, ‘My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive?<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.449, code:start</div></i>

And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.<i><div align='right'>, The Doré Bible Gallery, Complete: Containing One Hundred Superb Illustrations, and a Page of Explanatory Letter-press Facing Each, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

To which request her father consented, observing, nevertheless, that my conversation was ‘very mysterious.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

I was unable to understand her emotion at the time, but now when I reminded her of it she was surprised, and explained that she had felt so touched at my unexpected kindness to her son.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.387, code:start</div></i>

She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart.<i><div align='right'>Homer, The Odyssey: Rendered into English prose for the use of those who cannot read the original, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

O, she was naught, and long of her it was That we meet here so strangely; but her son Is gone, we know not how nor where.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.394, code:start</div></i>

She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.397, code:start</div></i>

Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just ‘lost' herself for a moment.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me?<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.414, code:start</div></i>

And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

Her familiar and genial presence proclaimed that my days of parental dependence were past and gone.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.416, code:start</div></i>

She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage and looked about me.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.322, code:start</div></i>

I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.322, code:start</div></i>

And yet the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

The candle-light, which made her invisible, fell full on my face, and she looked at me.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.346, code:start</div></i>

At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

But as I humbly explained my unpleasant plight, her face flushed and she looked at me in wonder.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.348, code:start</div></i>

She caught my arm as if she were about to fall, and uttered a faint cry.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.354, code:start</div></i>

And when I walked away from her, she at once put her handkerchief to her eyes again and wiped away rebellious tears, which would persist in rising again and again from her heart and dropping from her poor eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.355, code:start</div></i>

There was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as she recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her usual smile.<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.357, code:start</div></i>

I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

I wanted to hide my face in my hands and run away at once, but she glanced at my flowers as though she had completely forgotten that I had gathered them.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.361, code:start</div></i>

She had not been long there before she learned my disaster, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolence, inquired into the particulars of my fate.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

She then expressed a vehement desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes of my life since we parted, and excused her curiosity on account of the concern she had for my interest.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.361, code:start</div></i>

She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.371, code:start</div></i>

She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

Though I had all the reason in the world to resent her treacherous behaviour to me, I was moved at her distress, and professing my sorrow at seeing her so reduced desired her to sit, and inquired into the particulars of her situation.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.388, code:start</div></i>

Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.390, code:start</div></i>

I felt reassured, and continued more in the vein which hospitality indicated, to bid her welcome, and to tell her how much pleasure her accidental arrival had given us all, and especially what a happiness it was to me.<i><div align='right'>Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan, Carmilla, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

She looked up rather sadly, and as if I had thrown a new perplexity into her already distressed mind; and for a minute or two she did not speak.<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

I wondered if she had told Miss Pask of my presence before going, or whether she had just left me there, the butt of some grim practical joke of her own.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.417, code:start</div></i>

I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

I thanked her for the care she took of my interests, and, promising to behave myself according to her directions we parted, after she had assured me that I depend upon her best offices with her mistress, and that she would from time to time communicate to me such intelligence as she could procure, relating to my flame.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.403, code:start</div></i>

I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

I don't remember what we talked about; but she frequently sent me off on one pretext or another, to pick a flower, or to see who was riding in the next avenue.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.412, code:start</div></i>

Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.420, code:start</div></i>

I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I took her out into the gallery.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.422, code:start</div></i>

But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.422, code:start</div></i>

I encouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all her intentions with regard to me; and that, although my circumstances were extremely low, I would share my last farthing with her.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.424, code:start</div></i>

She had driven her husband away, and while I taught school a strange man lived there, big and jovial, and people talked.<i><div align='right'>Du Bois, W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), The Souls of Black Folk, distance:0.427, code:start</div></i>

She was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place, and that very day hired a genteel apartment in Park Street, whither I moved in a couch loaded with her baggage, and my own.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.428, code:start</div></i>

She got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

By evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

I returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the window.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.374, code:start</div></i>

Not having found me in Paris, she had pulled herself together with remarkable energy, and in pursuance of an earlier wish of mine, had rented a house on the lake of Zürich, installed herself comfortably, and remained there in the hope of at last hearing from me again.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went to ask if I were to be admitted.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

She took me upstairs, and there was no end to the care she lavished on me.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.392, code:start</div></i>

I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.405, code:start</div></i>

She did all she could for me, and procured me the necessary relief, and when I sank into a heavy slumber, unhesitatingly resigned her own bed to my use.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.410, code:start</div></i>

In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

I succeeded in assuring myself that she really only wished to get away from a position that filled her with desperation, and for this purpose had accepted the assistance of a man who sympathised with her, and that she was for the present seeking rest and shelter with her parents.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

I remember the tender ambition which inspired me to win the encouraging sympathy of this sensitive woman, who was painfully wasting away amid the coarsest surroundings.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.338, code:start</div></i>

No attempt to raise her to the level of my own mood was successful; she persisted in regarding me as an ill-advised, inconsiderate person who had plunged both himself and her into the most terrible situation.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.343, code:start</div></i>

For she loved my being with her, as mothers do, but much more than many; and she knew not how great joy Thou wert about to work for her out of my absence.<i><div align='right'>Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo, The Confessions of St. Augustine, distance:0.344, code:start</div></i>

At length growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my lawful wife, which I did.<i><div align='right'>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, Don Quixote, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

Her tears flowed over, and seeing her so genuinely perturbed I restrained my impatience, and took leave after a few words of sympathy.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

I did my utmost to give her confidence and to make her believe that our present misfortunes were but momentary.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.360, code:start</div></i>

So kindly disposed and sympathetic did she show herself towards me, that she even volunteered to lend me her services at a concert which I proposed to give for my own benefit, although this would necessitate her returning after a brief absence.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.361, code:start</div></i>

I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.366, code:start</div></i>

She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.375, code:start</div></i>

The courage and patience with which she had faced our difficulties, while I on my part had tried to end them by dint of hard work, had linked us together with bonds of iron.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.376, code:start</div></i>

Until then I had been able to think more lightly of the misery of her position, simply because I had imagined her to be more deeply in sympathy with what agitated me.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

My first indignation at the event accordingly subsided to such an extent that I gradually acquired more sympathy for her in her despair, and began to reproach myself both for my conduct and for having brought unhappiness on her.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.355, code:start</div></i>

Her agreeable and soothing qualities still had such a beneficial effect upon me, that with the frivolity natural to me, as well as the obstinacy with which I met all opposition, I silenced the inner voice that darkly foreboded disaster.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

Whether the old gentlewoman resented my abrupt departure so much that her love changed into disdain, or was ashamed to see me on account of her infirmity, I know not; but I was never troubled again with her passion.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.374, code:start</div></i>

As my story was little else than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of sympathy ceased not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during the whole of the narration, which, when I had finished, she recompensed me for my trouble with the most endearing protestations of eternal love.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.376, code:start</div></i>

As soon as she realised, however, that my condition was such as to render my removal impossible without great commotion, she rapidly formed a resolution which must indeed have cost her an effort, though it was carried out with the utmost calmness and good-humour.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

I was placed in an exceedingly melancholy situation by the fact that my circumstances had so shaped themselves that I dared not express this important change in my feelings to any one, especially to my poor wife.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

My wife was quite in despair, and the parting from her caused me real pain.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.316, code:start</div></i>

Finding myself suddenly deprived of the company and pleasures of the town, I grew melancholy and it was some time before I could relish my situation.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.331, code:start</div></i>

I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occasion; the more because there was nobody on board to whom I could communicate my sorrows, or of whom I could receive the least consolation or advice.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.334, code:start</div></i>

I was simply at a loss to convey to my poor exhausted wife how extremely I regretted the whole affair.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.366, code:start</div></i>

At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.376, code:start</div></i>

I was absolutely unable to bring my young wife to see my point of view, or to make her realise my own wounded feelings on these occasions, while the unrestrained violence of my speech and behaviour made an understanding once and for all impossible.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.377, code:start</div></i>

As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.378, code:start</div></i>

I was gratified with every indulgence I could desire; introduced into the company of women in my own situation, by whom an uncommon deference was paid to me; and I began to lose all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to my view with all its interesting circumstances.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.379, code:start</div></i>

While my mother, for instance, regarded my association with this highly respectable family with great satisfaction, I for my part was extremely gratified at the thought of the cordiality with which I was received in such circles.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.384, code:start</div></i>

Being thus provided with money and all necessaries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon myself as a gentleman of some consequence, and felt my pride dilate a pace.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

For this short though eventful period, during which I was quite free to give full scope to my inmost thoughts, I indulged in the consolation of purely artistic creations.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

She failed to understand her sudden longing for what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire had entered her heart.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.408, code:start</div></i>

I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.409, code:start</div></i>

Forgetting for the moment all the possible embarrassments which might arise, in my genuine delight at beholding the wonderful man before me, and hearing his work conducted by himself, I at once undertook to do everything I possibly could to meet his desires.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.414, code:start</div></i>

This piece of satisfaction I could not refuse to one who had saved my life, therefore related all my adventures without exaggeration or reserve.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

That I had found leisure to look into my follies and to repent of them.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.421, code:start</div></i>

Wretch that I am! to survive the loss of such an excellent woman, endeared to my remembrance by the most tender offices of wedlock, happily exercised for the space of five-and-twenty years!<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.422, code:start</div></i>

When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.423, code:start</div></i>

The sensations it occasioned were a mixture of joy and grief; somewhat like what divide the mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased friend, in which a large legacy, which his distresses make the more welcome, is bequeathed to him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

On this occasion the respect and devotion shown me by each member of the family had delighted me.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.404, code:start</div></i>

The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.409, code:start</div></i>

It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.410, code:start</div></i>

Soon, however, a longing seized me to give expression to the inspiration generated by this poem, so that I had the greatest difficulty in overcoming my desire to give up the rest I had been prescribed while partaking of the water of Marienbad.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.412, code:start</div></i>

The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.416, code:start</div></i>

The sensation of blissful content with which I saw my light-hearted legion of gaily dressed bandsmen and singers gathering through the auspicious morning mists on board our steamer, swelled my breast with a fervent faith in my lucky star.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.417, code:start</div></i>

Nothing but the sympathy inspired by communion with persons endowed with exceptional gifts enabled me to triumph over my scruples.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.418, code:start</div></i>

This experience left me with a pleasant feeling of ability and power, and strongly confirmed me in the belief, that if I only desired anything with sufficient earnestness, I was able to achieve it with irresistible and overwhelming success.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.419, code:start</div></i>

On the contrary, having the amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and disinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful nature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him spun little threads of tenderness from out his heart towards hers.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.421, code:start</div></i>

That peaceful and harmonious state of mind which is so favourable to creative work, and always so necessary to me for composing, I now had to secure with the greatest difficulty, for it was one of the things I always had the hardest struggle to obtain.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.428, code:start</div></i>

And yet the difficulties we had just overcome were but the prelude to the calamities incidental to this adventurous journey which had such a decisive influence on my life.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.376, code:start</div></i>

The characteristic and delicate sonority of the orchestra delighted me, and strengthened me in my resolve to be extremely sparing in the use of my orchestral material, in order to attain that abundance of combinations which I needed for my later works.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.384, code:start</div></i>

The peculiar direction which my musical activities had gradually taken continued to receive ever fresh impetus, not only from the successes, but also from the disasters which about this time befell my efforts.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.387, code:start</div></i>

When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

Thus for the present the unpleasant side of my success scarcely affected me at all, and for a brief space I felt myself, for the first and only time in my life, so pleasantly borne along on the breath of general good-will, that all my former troubles seemed amply requited.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.398, code:start</div></i>

The fantastic daring, the sharp precision with which the boldest combinations—almost tangible in their clearness—impressed me, drove back my own ideas of the poetry of music with brutal violence into the very depths of my soul.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.401, code:start</div></i>

Nevertheless, I knew very well that this seeming triumph could have no real substance, as only the immaterial parts of my work could reach the eyes and ears of the audience; its essential spirit had not entered their hearts.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.406, code:start</div></i>

That I might the more perfectly enjoy the possession of my amiable partner, who could no longer brook the thoughts of another separation, peace was no sooner re-established than I obtained leave to resign my commission, and I wholly devoted myself to the joys of a domestic life.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.411, code:start</div></i>

At first, under the safe guidance of my renewed wedded happiness, which had for a time been so disturbed in its early days, I felt distinctly better than I had before in all my professional work.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.415, code:start</div></i>

Amid my yearning anxiety to exert some influence upon the spirit in which our noblest masterpieces were executed, I had to struggle against the profound dissatisfaction I felt with my employment on the ordinary theatre repertoire.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.416, code:start</div></i>

Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.420, code:start</div></i>

Having the advantage of a good voice and education, I exerted my talents to the uttermost, and soon became the favourite with all company.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.393, code:start</div></i>

When you consider the place where I now was, and the company with whom I was, you will, I fancy, conceive that a very short time brought me to an end of that sum of which I had so iniquitously possessed myself.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.421, code:start</div></i>

Men of business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of the great distance at which I dwelt from something or other; and though they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was obvious that they did not.<i><div align='right'>Thoreau, Henry David, Walden, and On The Duty Of Civil Disobedience, distance:0.430, code:start</div></i>

To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company."<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.435, code:start</div></i>

I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.440, code:start</div></i>

I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.447, code:start</div></i>

All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.452, code:start</div></i>

I intend, then, in this last book, to imitate the good company I have mentioned in their last journey.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.453, code:start</div></i>

Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.455, code:start</div></i>

Owing to this I entered upon a series of entanglements and troubles which henceforth dominated my life, and plunged me into sorrows that left their dismal mark on all my subsequent enterprises.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.455, code:start</div></i>

That greediness then, wherewith I had of so long time expected that man, was delighted verily with his action and feeling when disputing, and his choice and readiness of words to clothe his ideas.<i><div align='right'>Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo, The Confessions of St. Augustine, distance:0.456, code:start</div></i>

I was filled with the most extraordinary feelings, but the spark of hope which was then kindled in my breast certainly had nothing whatever to do with the belief that had been imposed upon me from without, that I was to make a success in Paris as a composer of operas.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.456, code:start</div></i>

I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.456, code:start</div></i>

That he should so quickly assimilate the atmosphere, that he should at once become nothing but kindness, showed surely what a real affinity he had with good and beautiful things.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.315, code:start</div></i>

There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.320, code:start</div></i>

That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.326, code:start</div></i>

Besides this, he was under the shadow of a great sorrow which drew all sympathetic natures to him.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.327, code:start</div></i>

He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.329, code:start</div></i>

I saw from his knowledge and capacities that he would never be able to attain a position of great influence, but his kindness of heart and his extraordinarily receptive mind filled me with a feeling of profound respect for him.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.330, code:start</div></i>

The characteristic which pleased me in him was his absolute devotion, his quick comprehension of my position and the necessity of my resolutions, as well as his readiness to submit without question to all my arrangements, even where he himself was concerned.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.332, code:start</div></i>

The dearth of strong moral character, of unbending righteousness, he felt, was their great shortcoming, and here he would begin.<i><div align='right'>Du Bois, W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), The Souls of Black Folk, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say "you" to his equals and even those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king himself.<i><div align='right'>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, Don Quixote, distance:0.342, code:start</div></i>

The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only in finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.346, code:start</div></i>

An unheard-of virtue, supreme and sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

He knew him to be proud and ill-natured; he also knew that his divinity itself was tinctured with his temper, and such as in many respects he himself did by no means approve; but he was at the same time an excellent scholar, and most indefatigable in teaching the two lads.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.351, code:start</div></i>

He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.357, code:start</div></i>

He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, A Study in Scarlet, distance:0.320, code:start</div></i>

That was his first great rise, his first gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn't yet speak of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human being.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.330, code:start</div></i>

He had always known in a general way that he was not rich, but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.335, code:start</div></i>

Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.337, code:start</div></i>

Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.361, code:start</div></i>

He took the good luck that befell him so seriously, that he would brook no jesting, and at once laid hands on the fortune of his future wife, as he considered that it was disadvantageously and insecurely invested, and thought that he knew of much more profitable ways of employing it.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

This he conceived to be the best method of acquiring his good opinion; because the Englishman would naturally conclude he was a person who could have no sinister views upon his fortune, else he would have chosen quite a different manner of deportment.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and expectations of much more.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself, by dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection of rare copies of every sort.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

There was something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.371, code:start</div></i>

He had moreover many good qualities, and was a very generous good-natured man, and ready to do any service to his fellow-creatures.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.377, code:start</div></i>

He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemed pleased.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.324, code:start</div></i>

He was one of those fine, ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, Twenty years after, distance:0.331, code:start</div></i>

He observed, that what he had done was in obedience to the dictates of common humanity, which would have prompted him to assist any fellow-creature in distress; but that her peculiar virtue and qualifications were such as challenged the utmost exertion of his faculties in her service.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.331, code:start</div></i>

From that moment every political consideration and aim had been put in the background by his sympathy with this heroic attitude, and he had immediately resolved to assist this excellent man with all the devotion and energy of a friend.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.336, code:start</div></i>

He must therefore be Industrious, Valiant, Affable, Liberall and Fortunate, that he may gain an opinion both of sufficiency, and of loving his Souldiers.<i><div align='right'>Hobbes, Thomas, Leviathan, distance:0.337, code:start</div></i>

He was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.338, code:start</div></i>

His appearance was greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.340, code:start</div></i>

We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him everything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.341, code:start</div></i>

At length, by dint of unwearied attention to the duties of his profession, which he exercised with equal humanity and success, he had acquired tolerable share of business among the farmers and common people, which enabled him to live in a decent manner.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, distance:0.343, code:start</div></i>

Said he was kindest of kings under heaven, Gentlest of men, most winning of manner, 45 Friendliest to folk-troops and fondest of honor.<i><div align='right'>, Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

He was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate to Mr Allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one of the worthiest creatures in the world.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

And as for the lady, she had no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company with the highest degree of indifference; so that Mr Allworthy must have had the insight of the devil (or perhaps some of his worse qualities) to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going forward.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.305, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy could scarce refrain laughter at this; but he resolved to do a violence to himself; for he perfectly well knew mankind, and had too much good-breeding and good-nature to offend the squire in his present circumstances.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.321, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy was not one of those men whose hearts flutter at any unexpected and sudden tidings of worldly profit.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

And here, in defiance of all the barking critics in the world, I must and will introduce a digression concerning true wisdom, of which Mr Allworthy was in reality as great a pattern as he was of goodness.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.344, code:start</div></i>

Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.349, code:start</div></i>

She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned her own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had been the means of raising her own position.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.359, code:start</div></i>

Indeed, he was equally intitled to this virtue in either sense; for as no man was ever more sensible of the wants, or more ready to relieve the distresses of others, so none could be more tender of their characters, or slower to believe anything to their disadvantage.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.362, code:start</div></i>

If he saw such a consequence with horror and disdain, how much more was he shocked with what regarded Mr Allworthy; to whom, as he had more than filial obligations, so had he for him more than filial piety!<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

One would imagine she had distinguished this beast with her favour on account of his ugliness and ill-nature, if it was not, indeed, an instinctive sympathy, between his disposition and her own.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, distance:0.367, code:start</div></i>

And he had been so buffeted, so rudely entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at least a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes might be lacking.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

He once ventured to make a jest of the rule of right; and at another time said, he believed there was no rule in the world capable of making such a man as his father (for so Mr Allworthy suffered himself to be called).<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

He was one day engaged with Mr Allworthy in a discourse on charity: in which the captain, with great learning, proved to Mr Allworthy, that the word charity in Scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.371, code:start</div></i>

This a good deal soured the captain's temper, as did all the other daily instances of Mr Allworthy's generosity; for he looked on all such largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy very severely reprimanded the lad for his indecent and disrespectful expressions concerning his master; but much more for his avowing an intention of revenge.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

I have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy inherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.346, code:start</div></i>

He therefore deposited the said half-price himself; for he was a very prudent lad, and so careful of his money, that he had laid up almost every penny which he had received from Mr Allworthy.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.356, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy had given the fellow strict orders, on pain of forfeiting his place, never to trespass on any of his neighbours; no more on those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of this manor.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.366, code:start</div></i>

Had this fact been truly laid before Mr Allworthy, it might probably have done the gamekeeper very little mischief.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.369, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy excused himself from dining with the company, saying he had ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment, for that they had much private business to discourse of; but would not resist promising the good woman that both he and Jones would make part of her society at supper.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.370, code:start</div></i>

But what he loved and valued above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his superiors.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.372, code:start</div></i>

He owned the fact, and alledged no other excuse but what was really true, viz., that the covey was originally sprung in Mr Allworthy's own manor.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.373, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy now returned into the parlour; for he had been himself in search after the captain.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.375, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy then enquired for his nephew, and was told that he had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to come to him, and whom Mr Allworthy guessing rightly to be Mr Dowling, he desired presently to speak with him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.348, code:start</div></i>

After this Mr Allworthy again laid himself down on his pillow, and endeavoured to compose himself to rest.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.363, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his return home; but that he was then obliged to go on some business of consequence.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.368, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on some very particular business, though I know not what it was; but judge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home, whence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of many years.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.381, code:start</div></i>

He was proceeding when Mr Allworthy interposed, telling them very coldly, they had both mistaken his meaning; for that he had said nothing of true honour.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.385, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy then turned towards Tom, with more than usual anger in his countenance, and advised him to confess who was with him; repeating, that he was resolved to know.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.386, code:start</div></i>

When Allworthy returned to his lodgings, he heard Mr Jones was just arrived before him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.387, code:start</div></i>

Our doctors were about to take their leave, when Mr Allworthy, having given over the captain, and acquiesced in the Divine will, began to enquire after his sister, whom he desired them to visit before their departure.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.390, code:start</div></i>

So back they all went into Mr Allworthy's hall; where Tom desired them to stay till his return, and then went himself in pursuit of the good man.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.394, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy, who had settled all his affairs in this world, and was as well prepared as it is possible for human nature to be for the other, received this information with the utmost calmness and unconcern.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.397, code:start</div></i>

It was Mr Allworthy's custom never to punish any one, not even to turn away a servant, in a passion.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.397, code:start</div></i>

As to Mr Allworthy, he said, since the boy had been already punished he would not deliver his sentiments on the occasion; and whether he was or was not angry with the lad, I must leave to the reader's own conjecture.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.324, code:start</div></i>

The justice which Mr Allworthy had executed on Partridge at first met with universal approbation; but no sooner had he felt its consequences, than his neighbours began to relent, and to compassionate his case; and presently after, to blame that as rigour and severity which they before called justice.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.336, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy answered, "That he was sorry for what his nephew had done, but could not consent to punish him, as he acted rather from a generous than unworthy motive."<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

All his acquaintance were the acquaintance of Mr Allworthy; and he had no reason to expect any countenance from them, as that gentleman had withdrawn his favour from him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.349, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy was sufficiently offended by this transgression of Jones; for notwithstanding the assertions of Mr Western, it is certain this worthy man had never indulged himself in any loose pleasures with women, and greatly condemned the vice of incontinence in others.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

For such was the compassion which inhabited Mr Allworthy's mind, that nothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

The news of Mr Allworthy's danger (for the servant told him he was dying) drove all thoughts of love out of his head.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.364, code:start</div></i>

But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny, we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal intention whatever.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.365, code:start</div></i>

The spirit of compassion took control of him, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of the offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.388, code:start</div></i>

Here Mr Allworthy was again forced to interpose, and to relate what had passed between him and Sophia, at which he testified great surprize.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

Such a scene as this could not fail of affecting the heart of Mr Allworthy.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.389, code:start</div></i>

But whatever detestation Mr Allworthy had to this or to any other vice, he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any virtue in the guilty person, as clearly indeed as if there had been no mixture of vice in the same character.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.390, code:start</div></i>

By all which Jones had rather improved than injured the affection which Mr Allworthy was inclined to entertain for him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.393, code:start</div></i>

Jones received his effects from Mr Allworthy's early in the morning, with the following answer to his letter:--<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.281, code:start</div></i>

Now some conceits of this kind were likewise lurking in the mind of Partridge; for, as he was now persuaded that Jones had run away from Mr Allworthy, he promised himself the highest rewards if he could by any means convey him back.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.283, code:start</div></i>

Mr Allworthy at last agreed to this invitation, and soon after the squire went off, singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the speedy tragical end of poor Jones.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.299, code:start</div></i>

Mr Jones, then, had often heard Mr Allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.332, code:start</div></i>

And indeed I believe there are few favours which he would not have gladly conferred on Mr Jones; for he bore as much gratitude towards him as he could, and was as honest as men who love money better than any other thing in the universe, generally are.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.338, code:start</div></i>

The reader may remember that Mr Allworthy gave Tom Jones a little horse, as a kind of smart-money for the punishment which he imagined he had suffered innocently.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.339, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy took an opportunity, whilst he was in the chair, of reading the letter from Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered him; and there were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears from his eyes.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.344, code:start</div></i>

In fact, when Partridge came to ruminate on the relation he had heard from Jones, he could not reconcile to himself that Mr Allworthy should turn his son (for so he most firmly believed him to be) out of doors, for any reason which he had heard assigned.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.347, code:start</div></i>

He then gave Allworthy a very particular account of their first meeting, and of everything, as well as he could remember, which had happened from that day to this; frequently interlarding his story with panegyrics on Jones, and not forgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for Allworthy.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.348, code:start</div></i>

It will be believed that Mr Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very severe lecture on this occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it here, as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to Jenny Jones in the first book, most of which may be applied to the men, equally with the women.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.351, code:start</div></i>

If this part of his character pleased Mr Allworthy, it delighted Miss Bridget.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.380, code:start</div></i>

The reader must be very weak, if, when he considers the light in which Jones then appeared to Mr Allworthy, he should blame the rigour of his sentence.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.383, code:start</div></i>

Allworthy spoke this with great reserve; for the reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this lady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge had now delivered.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.395, code:start</div></i>

Though Mrs Deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of Jenny, from the reasons above shewn, it is possible Mr Allworthy might have required some stronger evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her accusers any such trouble, by freely confessing the whole fact with which she was charged.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.396, code:start</div></i>

Certain it is that his wife repented heartily of the evidence she had given against him: especially when she found Mrs Deborah had deceived her, and refused to make any application to Mr Allworthy on her behalf.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.276, code:start</div></i>

This will be, I am afraid, always the case while they remain among their former acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr Allworthy, to remove Jenny to a place where she might enjoy the pleasure of reputation, after having tasted the ill consequences of losing it.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.429, code:start</div></i>

He therefore once more exhorted Partridge to confess; but he still avowing his innocence, Mr Allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt, and that he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.430, code:start</div></i>

A lawyer may perhaps think Mr Allworthy exceeded his authority a little in this instance.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.436, code:start</div></i>

Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.439, code:start</div></i>

These solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: for though Mr Allworthy did not think, with some late writers, that mercy consists only in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals wantonly, without any reason whatever.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.452, code:start</div></i>

These solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: for though Mr Allworthy did not think, with some late writers, that mercy consists only in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals wantonly, without any reason whatever.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.000, code:interp_0</div></i>

But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny, we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal intention whatever.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.379, code:interp_1</div></i>

Of readers who, from such conceits as these, condemn the wisdom or penetration of Mr Allworthy, I shall not scruple to say, that they make a very bad and ungrateful use of that knowledge which we have communicated to them.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.371, code:interp_2</div></i>

For such was the compassion which inhabited Mr Allworthy's mind, that nothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.395, code:interp_3</div></i>

As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.421, code:end</div></i>

The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.418, code:end</div></i>

The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal's, when you do it a kindness that it understands.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.413, code:end</div></i>

In all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, Twenty years after, distance:0.412, code:end</div></i>

Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.407, code:end</div></i>

In short, I had all the reason in the world to believe that this gentle creature's bosom was possessed by a passion for me, as warm, though perhaps not so impetuous as mine for her.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

Her beauty was, I think, enhanced by that graceful languor that was peculiar to her.<i><div align='right'>Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan, Carmilla, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

And yet one would have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary, a good‐natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but so like other handsome ordinary women!<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.400, code:end</div></i>

As she was one of the most innocent creatures in the world, so she was one of the most chearful.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.391, code:end</div></i>

Holy, fair, and wise is she; The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admired be.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.383, code:end</div></i>

These pictures still remained, representing her fair as the most perfect idea of beauty, soft and tender as an angel of mercy and compassion, warmed with every virtue of the heart, and adorned with every accomplishment of human nature.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.381, code:end</div></i>

No ordinary man could have withstood that look, the creature was so lovely in her rich health and graceful position.<i><div align='right'>Stephens, Ann S. (Ann Sophia), Esther : $b A story of the Oregon trail, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

Indeed, she had a much better title to respect than this; for she was one of the most beautiful creatures in the world.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.442, code:end</div></i>

Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.441, code:end</div></i>

Later on I saw and fully realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all, but only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I could not indeed have helped doing.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.436, code:end</div></i>

She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.435, code:end</div></i>

I began; but looking at her I had not the heart to go on, and what was I to say to her?<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.432, code:end</div></i>

Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.431, code:end</div></i>

She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.425, code:end</div></i>

It was my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome, and I can truly say I liked her the better on that account.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.425, code:end</div></i>

She interested and won me; she was so beautiful and so indescribably engaging.<i><div align='right'>Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan, Carmilla, distance:0.423, code:end</div></i>

And yet the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.418, code:end</div></i>

She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

There was perhaps much that was good in her young heart, but it was embittered too early.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

Why was it that it was only she whom I cared to follow with my eyes, though I certainly had no inclination in those days to watch ladies and seek their acquaintance?<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.392, code:end</div></i>

I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.442, code:end</div></i>

This remarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree, that I begged she would favour me with the particulars of her story, and she complied in these words.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.440, code:end</div></i>

She did so evidently feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the syllables.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.440, code:end</div></i>

I was astonished to learn, first from her reserved manner, and later from her own lips, that she felt compelled to inquire into the seriousness of my intentions, and to consider their consequences.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.440, code:end</div></i>

It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.431, code:end</div></i>

From time to time she raised her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.429, code:end</div></i>

The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.428, code:end</div></i>

They treated her with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.428, code:end</div></i>

She heard herself saying things that really sounded quite interesting and even amusing.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.421, code:end</div></i>

There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.409, code:end</div></i>

His tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.406, code:end</div></i>

The other females seemed to listen with a mixture of wonder and devotion.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, distance:0.390, code:end</div></i>

It was very curious, and no one in the world could have been more surprised than she herself, but she wanted to think.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.388, code:end</div></i>

Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

And, what was even more unusual, she appeared, he observed, not even to mind.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.373, code:end</div></i>

Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.<i><div align='right'>Melville, Herman, Moby Dick; Or, The Whale, distance:0.355, code:end</div></i>

There was a subtle fascination in the subject for her, though she had not yet faced this fact.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,--<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

She was watching him with intense curiosity and still some uneasiness.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.338, code:end</div></i>

She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

On the other hand, she often looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his face never showed the least consciousness.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.315, code:end</div></i>

He looked at Anne as if he were thinking some things about her that couldn't be expressed in words.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.314, code:end</div></i>

When she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.310, code:end</div></i>

And yet he felt as if something had happened to him with regard to her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.304, code:end</div></i>

She felt that something had happened to him, but he said nothing to her about his love.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.300, code:end</div></i>

She wanted to know if he ever thought about her when she wasn't before his eyes, and, if so, what.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.293, code:end</div></i>

She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.289, code:end</div></i>

She looked at him and did not think, but felt, about something different.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.359, code:end</div></i>

He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

But for the rest of the time she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.347, code:end</div></i>

He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.340, code:end</div></i>

She looked at him rather frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was to do.<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up at him beseechingly, without speaking.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.328, code:end</div></i>

She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

He looked at the crowd, and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.400, code:end</div></i>

Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion's sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.398, code:end</div></i>

He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his face.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.394, code:end</div></i>

Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed, that there was a feeble smile upon his lips.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.392, code:end</div></i>

He avoided polite attentions; he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.388, code:end</div></i>

At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

He leapt impulsively to his feet, and a scared look came into his face.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half senseless smile strayed on his lips.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.363, code:end</div></i>

He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to his lips.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.358, code:end</div></i>

In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent, he stepped behind him to smile.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

But his smile faded into shadow as the doctor, with a very grave face, beckoned him to him.<i><div align='right'>Le Fanu, Joseph Sheridan, Carmilla, distance:0.370, code:end</div></i>

He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.370, code:end</div></i>

His face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his being intensely excited.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.364, code:end</div></i>

The magician began to pull his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy, nonchalant smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.364, code:end</div></i>

Their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

His expression showed the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.338, code:end</div></i>

This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.334, code:end</div></i>

Arkady, taking this smile as a sign that all his uneasiness was over, and the look that succeeded it as an indication that he was determined to do better, was greatly relieved.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

He drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

He caught himself nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete smiles of his, and said:<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.338, code:end</div></i>

Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.332, code:end</div></i>

And yet one glance at his face made one forgive him much,—that broad, good-natured smile in which lay no bit of art or artifice, but seemed just bubbling good-nature and genuine satisfaction with the world.<i><div align='right'>Du Bois, W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt), The Souls of Black Folk, distance:0.328, code:end</div></i>

But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.321, code:end</div></i>

They smiled, not because they were happy but because they wished to make happy.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.285, code:end</div></i>

He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.280, code:end</div></i>

He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.405, code:end</div></i>

He had been crawling out from under his car then, too, and he had given her a cheerful grin as she went by—a little, whimsical grin that gave him the look of an amused gnome.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

She found herself smiling inwardly to think what a commotion she could make if she chose.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.393, code:end</div></i>

A strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.393, code:end</div></i>

Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.390, code:end</div></i>

He tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently kissed her hand and went out.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

He even smiled, but the same melancholy expression came back to his face at once.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.386, code:end</div></i>

She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned pale.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.385, code:end</div></i>

Suddenly she chanced to look at him intently: he laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.381, code:end</div></i>

An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in his pale smile.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.354, code:end</div></i>

The smile was delicious and when Clifford, incapable of sustaining himself on his legs from sheer astonishment, toppled slightly, she smiled again in spite of herself.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her wondering childish eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.399, code:end</div></i>

She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

He looked feebly around the table to see what the others thought of it.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her face.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she seated herself beside him, and said—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

And Barney smiling his twisted, enigmatical smile at her across the table.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

Turning the angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

He hastened to "reassure" her and made her sit down facing him at the table.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.365, code:end</div></i>

She sat down on the marble bench lately occupied by Clifford, and tilting her parasol over her small head looked at him.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

When she was seated at the little table with Clifford opposite she smiled and leaned forward on both elbows looking him in the face.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.394, code:end</div></i>

After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:--<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.388, code:end</div></i>

She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and twisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.385, code:end</div></i>

As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.383, code:end</div></i>

He looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his chair close up to her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

She stood looking at her and Rose with an expression that appeared to be one of anger.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

He did look round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

Still he was motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him, took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying in a distressed tone—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.368, code:end</div></i>

He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be battling with his own anger, while she looked towards him sadly.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.395, code:end</div></i>

She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.394, code:end</div></i>

He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, distance:0.387, code:end</div></i>

He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, distance:0.386, code:end</div></i>

After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the door, crying out:<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.385, code:end</div></i>

His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

And he sank back in his chair and, covering his face with his hands, burst into tears.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall—as close as it would go—and ground it against it—and sat down.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.358, code:end</div></i>

He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

His face, already paler than usual, took on a scowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.378, code:end</div></i>

But his figure fell into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.376, code:end</div></i>

He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, A Study in Scarlet, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards towards his nose, a sign of savage reverie.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.373, code:end</div></i>

When they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed, his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

His face was pale and drawn, like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, Twenty years after, distance:0.357, code:end</div></i>

At that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to lift and wrinkle.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.352, code:end</div></i>

As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

He puckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.340, code:end</div></i>

He found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost all movement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.321, code:end</div></i>

His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

He had a broad, fresh face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary dress.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.340, code:end</div></i>

He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

His face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles, particularly numerous about his eyes, which were small, light‐colored, quick, and shining like two bright points.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.334, code:end</div></i>

His soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.324, code:end</div></i>

He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

He had rather high cheekbones; small, very red, but not very thick, lips; his nose was small and unmistakably turned up.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.307, code:end</div></i>

He had a straight-forward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.305, code:end</div></i>

He had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.272, code:end</div></i>

His face too was accounted handsome by the generality of women, for it was broad and ruddy, with tolerably good teeth.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.269, code:end</div></i>

His face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.343, code:end</div></i>

She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.336, code:end</div></i>

His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.325, code:end</div></i>

The stern and already rigid profile of her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.312, code:end</div></i>

Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.310, code:end</div></i>

Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

Her hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow's foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.345, code:end</div></i>

Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.343, code:end</div></i>

They saw only her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids were still swollen with sleep.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.341, code:end</div></i>

Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.333, code:end</div></i>

She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.329, code:end</div></i>

The contour of her face was oval; her forehead remarkably high; her complexion clean and delicate, though not florid; and her eyes were so piercing, as to strike the soul of every beholder.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

The old woman's face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.309, code:end</div></i>

Her face had become of a deathlier paleness, her lips trembled, and she pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that lay under them.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

Her face was thin and yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.293, code:end</div></i>

Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put out with weeping.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.290, code:end</div></i>

Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her cheeks sunken.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.266, code:end</div></i>

She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes were sunken and she was pale.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.242, code:end</div></i>

Her face had shriveled, her upper lip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.399, code:end</div></i>

She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.397, code:end</div></i>

She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.391, code:end</div></i>

Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Hound of the Baskervilles, distance:0.390, code:end</div></i>

Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

Her eyebrows were full, even, and arched beyond the power of art to imitate.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.387, code:end</div></i>

Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised; Of what she was no semblance did remain.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.359, code:end</div></i>

She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.358, code:end</div></i>

The animation faded out of her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.318, code:end</div></i>

Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

By another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her features.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.376, code:end</div></i>

She wore a starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose.<i><div align='right'>Conrad, Joseph, Heart of Darkness, distance:0.375, code:end</div></i>

She took off all her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly like an early Methodist.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.370, code:end</div></i>

In her small narrow head the only marked prominence was that of the brow projecting roundly over pale spectacled eyes.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

Her gown was spotless, and her big straw hat, tipped a little from the white forehead, threw a shadow across her eyes.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.364, code:end</div></i>

Another circlet of them went round her hair, dressed in the low puffs that became her.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.359, code:end</div></i>

Even from the time when my recollection of her is quite distinct, she always had to wear a cap owing to some slight affection of the head, so that I have no recollection of her as a young and pretty mother.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and in which she was still pretty.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

The needles clicked lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.366, code:end</div></i>

She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

Up went her hands, and she was turned to stone; her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.359, code:end</div></i>

Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light, the face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the slightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

She was not looking at the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her large eyes were fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.<i><div align='right'>Carroll, Lewis, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, distance:0.341, code:end</div></i>

He was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too, bent her head lower.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

Her eyes showed that she had come with an object, and in order to say something.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.302, code:end</div></i>

She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.366, code:end</div></i>

He laid down his hat, flung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked down for some moments without speaking.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.366, code:end</div></i>

She was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.363, code:end</div></i>

Then she sat down again on her chair, and became absorbed in thought once more.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

She got up and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to the small sitting room.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.360, code:end</div></i>

She sank into the chair, and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were hurrying upon her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

He sat perfectly still, leaning hard against the back of his chair; he could not venture to rise, and when he began to speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.354, code:end</div></i>

Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it before the portrait.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.328, code:end</div></i>

She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.304, code:end</div></i>

Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.390, code:end</div></i>

Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.386, code:end</div></i>

Oh how could you, Anne?" breathed Diana as they went down the road half reproachfully, half admiringly.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Anne's slim milk-white throat.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.381, code:end</div></i>

Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.378, code:end</div></i>

This unnatural solemnity lasted until after Diana had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room, toes in position.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

She cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, who held her up.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand to the latter whenever she turned to look back.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

Diana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her hands to her head.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.395, code:end</div></i>

Then he sat rigid in his place, with his teeth clenched and his arms across his chest.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.386, code:end</div></i>

He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close, without knowing what he was doing.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.383, code:end</div></i>

She gave her hand for a moment, and then they went to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another opposite.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.379, code:end</div></i>

She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding it out before her as though motioning him away.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.375, code:end</div></i>

He touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her dress, then he sat down facing her, without a word.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

She seized him by the hands, and almost by force made him sit down on the bed.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

Will stood still an instant looking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.347, code:end</div></i>

She sat down beside him, and still keeping his hands pressed them violently.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

With the same helplessness and the same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more immovably on him.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.370, code:end</div></i>

And she had unconsciously laid her hand again on the little hand that she had pressed before.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.366, code:end</div></i>

In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.361, code:end</div></i>

As he put her gently down in a chair, she could have kissed the slender, brown hands that touched her arms.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.352, code:end</div></i>

Lydgate drew his chair near to hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his powerful tender hand.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.336, code:end</div></i>

They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her.<i><div align='right'>Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank), The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, distance:0.334, code:end</div></i>

He actually risked laying a hand on her arm and pressing her mildly back among her cushions.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.383, code:end</div></i>

Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.376, code:end</div></i>

She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking, for her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered it speedily.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

She flung her arms around his neck and lifted her lips to his; and the exonerated and emancipated Professor took what she offered like a man.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

She gave him her gloved hand a moment and then withdrew it with a start.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a taking.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

Her scissors fell jingling to the floor; she tossed the unfinished frock after them, and putting both arms about his neck drew him down into her lap.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

And she threw herself into his arms, holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.347, code:end</div></i>

All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked with blood.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

She jumped on it, putting her arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.306, code:end</div></i>

She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.394, code:end</div></i>

So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy's head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.390, code:end</div></i>

She saw them drooping heavily beneath a rain of dew, and going up to them, swept the drops off with her hands, thus taking a morning bath which was half moisture, half perfume.<i><div align='right'>Stephens, Ann S. (Ann Sophia), Esther : $b A story of the Oregon trail, distance:0.387, code:end</div></i>

Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.387, code:end</div></i>

He felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.385, code:end</div></i>

He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on again.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.380, code:end</div></i>

First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.373, code:end</div></i>

She put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her aching chest.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.<i><div align='right'>Doyle, Arthur Conan, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

Tessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum from a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.355, code:end</div></i>

She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.325, code:end</div></i>

She swallowed furiously, and then jerked the flower wreath from around her own neck and flung it over Meta's head.<i><div align='right'>Mead, Margaret, Coming of age in Samoa : $b A psychological study of primitive youth for western civilisation, distance:0.310, code:end</div></i>

He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.406, code:end</div></i>

But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.<i><div align='right'>Melville, Herman, Moby Dick; Or, The Whale, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

They felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the invisible flowers were everywhere.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.397, code:end</div></i>

The pure, healthful, living, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.392, code:end</div></i>

But the flower I lifted from the table was fresh and fragile and filled the air with perfume.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.392, code:end</div></i>

His words and actions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.373, code:end</div></i>

All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.360, code:end</div></i>

He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain.<i><div align='right'>Wilde, Oscar, The Picture of Dorian Gray, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

Behind her sat Anatole, and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.375, code:end</div></i>

It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walking very softly.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

Strange as this was, it was the only thing in the situation which was evident—that, and the softness of her cheek against his, and the long-forgotten sweet smell of her.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.374, code:end</div></i>

Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more terrible even than terror; she shivered.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.370, code:end</div></i>

There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

And as he held her close to his heart and her arms were soft round his neck, he felt stealing over him a delicious sense of—at first he didn't know what it was, this delicate, pervading warmth, and then he recognised it as security.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

She wanted to gather to her bosom, to comfort and protect, soothing the dear head that should lie on it with softest strokings and murmurs of love.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.364, code:end</div></i>

But for his insistence she would have taken no rest: her brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had always been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye and plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that used most to interest her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

From her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her in suspense.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

How could he hinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.369, code:end</div></i>

He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed along.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.363, code:end</div></i>

And still on him she gazed, and gazing still, Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied, That she concludes the picture was belied.<i><div align='right'>Shakespeare, William, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, distance:0.357, code:end</div></i>

She looked at her lover with some wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood that she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.336, code:end</div></i>

She was obliged to let him see it, and, looking at her severely, he said—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.332, code:end</div></i>

She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.320, code:end</div></i>

She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.318, code:end</div></i>

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.315, code:end</div></i>

She therefore conveyed him softly into her closet, where she assured him he might remain with great tranquillity, in full confidence that she would take such measures as would effectually screen him from detection.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T.

She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if she could do anything for him.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.356, code:end</div></i>

He listened till her footsteps were silent, trying to tell from the sound of the shutting door which room she had gone into, then wandered aimlessly away through the hall again, and found himself back in the top garden.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

She came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

As it were wondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.342, code:end</div></i>

When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.320, code:end</div></i>

It was as if she feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.309, code:end</div></i>

He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

Her cordial look, when she put out her hand to him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Ulysses, distance:0.334, code:end</div></i>

She looked straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.332, code:end</div></i>

To see him, talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.332, code:end</div></i>

And when, looking up, her eyes met his dull despairing glance, her pity for him surmounted her anger and all her other anxieties.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.324, code:end</div></i>

For an instant he met her gaze, but what he read there sent a chill to his heart and he sat down covering his face with his hands.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.320, code:end</div></i>

She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking gravely at him.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.315, code:end</div></i>

He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.315, code:end</div></i>

But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his hand.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.299, code:end</div></i>

And, crushed as he was by his own sorrow, his eyes involuntarily rested on her with attention.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.271, code:end</div></i>

He just stood looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.324, code:end</div></i>

Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's sympathy.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.322, code:end</div></i>

Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the room.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.322, code:end</div></i>

Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.309, code:end</div></i>

She looked at him silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

She spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.307, code:end</div></i>

But she brightened, and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she said—<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.294, code:end</div></i>

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.287, code:end</div></i>

She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.345, code:end</div></i>

But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into tears.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.345, code:end</div></i>

Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she pressed it away as quietly as the first.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.342, code:end</div></i>

He was bowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone would have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.341, code:end</div></i>

Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

But suddenly in the middle of a sentence her eyes filled with tears, her voice failed, she turned away, and bowed down to the church pavement to hide her grief.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.336, code:end</div></i>

Again the old fear came upon her, and with throbbing heart she bent her head and gave way to a passionate burst of tears.<i><div align='right'>Stephens, Ann S. (Ann Sophia), Esther : $b A story of the Oregon trail, distance:0.334, code:end</div></i>

As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears began to fall.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.328, code:end</div></i>

A new light had dawned in her face, and the glow of it was already drying her tears.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

With these words, a flood of tears gushed from her enchanting eyes, and she instantly withdrew into her own apartment, where she indulged her sorrow to excess.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.317, code:end</div></i>

On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary's pace suddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.317, code:end</div></i>

She could even smile—a faint, sweet, wintry smile—as if to reassure us of her power to endure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than if she had cried outright.<i><div align='right'>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, Cranford, distance:0.316, code:end</div></i>

All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.315, code:end</div></i>

She looked preoccupied; I even fancied that her eyes were red with recent weeping.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.290, code:end</div></i>

She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears came into her eyes.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.271, code:end</div></i>

Her tears had stopped, but her look of solicitude slowly grew into a stare of something like terror.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

My first indignation at the event accordingly subsided to such an extent that I gradually acquired more sympathy for her in her despair, and began to reproach myself both for my conduct and for having brought unhappiness on her.<i><div align='right'>Wagner, Richard, My Life — Volume 1, distance:0.352, code:end</div></i>

I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.347, code:end</div></i>

The tears gushed down my cheeks; I stood motionless and silent for some time.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.347, code:end</div></i>

As my story was little else than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of sympathy ceased not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during the whole of the narration, which, when I had finished, she recompensed me for my trouble with the most endearing protestations of eternal love.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

I called to her, but she slipped away with a tormenting smile at my helpless hands, and I followed her with some impatience.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

She was moved and agitated as I had never seen her before, and tears were glistening on her cheeks.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.338, code:end</div></i>

I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.329, code:end</div></i>

And when I walked away from her, she at once put her handkerchief to her eyes again and wiped away rebellious tears, which would persist in rising again and again from her heart and dropping from her poor eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.329, code:end</div></i>

She knew me immediately; and, straining me gently in her arms, shed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increasing.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Roderick Random, distance:0.313, code:end</div></i>

She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.282, code:end</div></i>

Her tears flowed over, and seeing her so genuinely perturbed I restrained my impatience, and took leave after a few words of sympathy.<i><div align='right'>Wharton, Edith, Caswell, Edward C., Here and beyond, distance:0.357, code:end</div></i>

All existence seemed to beat with a lower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry, the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and shrinking away from her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:--<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

But the lovely creature seemed silent and reserved, though no one could have been more attentive and loving if any one needed sympathy.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.341, code:end</div></i>

She appeared much dejected; and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.339, code:end</div></i>

He saw that she put little faith in his consolation, but she was better for having had her sorrow out, for having spoken of it.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

The emotion had wrought itself more and more into her utterance, till the tones might have gone to one's very marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.290, code:end</div></i>

Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.<i><div align='right'>Stoker, Bram, Dracula, distance:0.354, code:end</div></i>

She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.353, code:end</div></i>

She was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after the other, her chin trembling as she wiped them away.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.352, code:end</div></i>

But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.325, code:end</div></i>

As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fond of talking.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.313, code:end</div></i>

It could be seen that she had wished to speak, but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion's words.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, Twenty years after, distance:0.305, code:end</div></i>

She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically as she could talk.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.304, code:end</div></i>

There were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.298, code:end</div></i>

She was more silent, quieter, and, if she cried, she cried quietly so as not to be heard.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.429, code:end</div></i>

She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.416, code:end</div></i>

He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.415, code:end</div></i>

Nothing. You mustn't cry here," he said, looking at her with the same cold expression.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.395, code:end</div></i>

Natásha cried angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

Her eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried in a low tone.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.379, code:end</div></i>

She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.375, code:end</div></i>

She stopped in speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if she were being inwardly grappled.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.360, code:end</div></i>

She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.415, code:end</div></i>

She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold Anne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous!<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.407, code:end</div></i>

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.407, code:end</div></i>

She seemed to be quivering with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her voice.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.405, code:end</div></i>

This was the first serious disagreement, her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.399, code:end</div></i>

She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, distance:0.395, code:end</div></i>

She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.394, code:end</div></i>

And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean backward and rest.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.387, code:end</div></i>

It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:<i><div align='right'>Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank), The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, distance:0.358, code:end</div></i>

I don't know what sort of an apology I offered for my inane, though harmless speech, but I know that she seemed so troubled about it that I began to think I had said something very dreadful without knowing it, and remembered with horror the pitfalls and snares which the French language sets for foreigners.<i><div align='right'>Chambers, Robert W. (Robert William), The King in Yellow, distance:0.316, code:end</div></i>

It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E. M. (Edward Morgan), A Room with a View, distance:0.438, code:end</div></i>

I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.436, code:end</div></i>

The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Oliver Twist, distance:0.432, code:end</div></i>

So she went on in her neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby's robes.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.429, code:end</div></i>

Some one noticed that she was pale and agitated, and others made the same remark.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.428, code:end</div></i>

She hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded," retorted Anne, evasive and defiant.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.423, code:end</div></i>

He had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek, he did not flinch from his friend's gaze.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.413, code:end</div></i>

My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Charlotte, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

I asked a minute later, almost angrily, turning my head slightly towards her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Notes from the Underground, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

I asked a minute later, almost angrily, turning my head slightly towards her.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, White Nights and Other Stories: The Novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Volume X, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

That she colored and gave rather a startled movement did not surprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday—a beneficent agitation, he thought, since it seemed to have made her turn to him again.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with unexpected amiability...<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.421, code:end</div></i>

But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.419, code:end</div></i>

It was not exactly that she was upset, she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.418, code:end</div></i>

She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she could not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be untruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

She exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.410, code:end</div></i>

Well, she was in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was so mad.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, distance:0.399, code:end</div></i>

With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.398, code:end</div></i>

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.393, code:end</div></i>

Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.382, code:end</div></i>

Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), Anne of Green Gables, distance:0.360, code:end</div></i>

Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.337, code:end</div></i>

She dared not be outraged, but she did not mean to be cheated of her tears.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.354, code:end</div></i>

She did not understand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at length she cried:—<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.340, code:end</div></i>

Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.337, code:end</div></i>

He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.337, code:end</div></i>

But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of her words.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.335, code:end</div></i>

She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.319, code:end</div></i>

She knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.301, code:end</div></i>

She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.293, code:end</div></i>

She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.292, code:end</div></i>

The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.291, code:end</div></i>

She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.349, code:end</div></i>

The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not given to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to tremble and the tears welled up.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.345, code:end</div></i>

She too joined in the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed tears.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.337, code:end</div></i>

Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.337, code:end</div></i>

Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went on quietly:<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.331, code:end</div></i>

Here she sunk down in her chair, drowned in her tears, and, in all the moving silence of unutterable grief, presented a spectacle which must have affected almost the hardest heart.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.330, code:end</div></i>

At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away.<i><div align='right'>Baum, L. Frank (Lyman Frank), The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too.<i><div align='right'>Fitzgerald, F. Scott (Francis Scott), The Great Gatsby, distance:0.322, code:end</div></i>

Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.312, code:end</div></i>

She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by sobs.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.312, code:end</div></i>

She cried as a child does, because her nose had to be cleared, and so on.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.284, code:end</div></i>

As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.333, code:end</div></i>

She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.332, code:end</div></i>

She failed to understand her sudden longing for what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire had entered her heart.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.329, code:end</div></i>

It was impossible for her to overlook such studied emotions; she in a jocose manner taxed him with having lost his heart, rallied the excess of his passion, and in a merry strain undertook to be an advocate for his love.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.328, code:end</div></i>

Thus the alternative she offered was either to retain the chain and be happy in her affection, or forfeit all title to her love, and die in the conviction of having brought his innocent mistress to an untimely grave.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

With these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart.<i><div align='right'>Cervantes Saavedra, Miguel de, Don Quixote, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

That pale, sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.324, code:end</div></i>

In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical weeping.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

He was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after having lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.322, code:end</div></i>

She deemed it her crime most to be repented of, that she had ever endured, and reciprocated, the lukewarm grasp of his hand, and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.319, code:end</div></i>

Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete, distance:0.308, code:end</div></i>

Something in him had suddenly changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.294, code:end</div></i>

She accordingly looked upon him with horror and detestation; but nevertheless resolved to treat him with civility in the meantime, that the poor young lady might not be disturbed in her last moments; for she had now lost all hopes of her recovery.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.266, code:end</div></i>

She sighed at the sad remembrance of that virgin dignity which she had lost; she wept at the prospect of that disgrace, mortification, and misery she should undergo, when abandoned by this transient lover, and severely reproached him for the arts he had used to shipwreck her innocence and peace.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, Great Expectations, distance:0.351, code:end</div></i>

She only felt that there was something irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the future were the more readily shapen into resolve.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

It was this preoccupation with the hardship of Will's wanting money, while she had what ought to have been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained silent and looked away from her—<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.346, code:end</div></i>

She knew that Will had received a severe blow, but she had been little used to imagining other people's states of mind except as a material cut into shape by her own wishes; and she believed in her own power to soothe or subdue.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.343, code:end</div></i>

But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be overlooked.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.338, code:end</div></i>

But her silence shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this misfortune in Will's lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to her clinging thought.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.333, code:end</div></i>

And yet, so heavily did the world weigh on her in spite of her independent energy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a disadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that unfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the opinion of every one connected with her.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.324, code:end</div></i>

Her whole heart was going out at this moment in sympathy with Will's indignation: she only wanted to convince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to have turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly world.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.310, code:end</div></i>

She felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so clear to her before was mysteriously spoiled.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.302, code:end</div></i>

She had accepted her whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail because she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of her lot.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.329, code:end</div></i>

It did not seem possible that she could have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her story.<i><div align='right'>Montgomery, L. M. (Lucy Maud), The Blue Castle: a novel, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

She did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.327, code:end</div></i>

But she was not joyous: her married life had fulfilled none of her hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her imagination.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.325, code:end</div></i>

It wanted that final touch of warmth and beauty, for he never thought of his wife except in terms of warmth and beauty—she would of course be beautiful and kind.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.318, code:end</div></i>

She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.310, code:end</div></i>

At that moment she would not have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness that her husband's earlier connections were not quite on a level with her own.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.306, code:end</div></i>

And she had not reached that point of renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a wise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.291, code:end</div></i>

Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband's plans, thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.280, code:end</div></i>

And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.344, code:end</div></i>

His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.340, code:end</div></i>

The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.336, code:end</div></i>

The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too.<i><div align='right'>Dickens, Charles, A Tale of Two Cities, distance:0.333, code:end</div></i>

Everything he had said might refer to that other relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was thoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband's injurious act.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these emotions were more than she could endure.<i><div align='right'>Hugo, Victor, Les Misérables, distance:0.325, code:end</div></i>

She was always trying to be what her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she was.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.323, code:end</div></i>

She had too much discernment to overlook his uncommon talents and agreeable address, and too much susceptibility to observe them with indifference.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.322, code:end</div></i>

His lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment.<i><div align='right'>Brontë, Emily, Wuthering Heights, distance:0.304, code:end</div></i>

She could not in the least make clear to herself the reasons for her husband's dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully impressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to others.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.290, code:end</div></i>

She was as blind to his inward troubles as he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her husband which claim our pity.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.274, code:end</div></i>

Adoring her husband's virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences cheerfully.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.259, code:end</div></i>

Everything seemed hindrance to her till she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.254, code:end</div></i>

She attributed immense importance to all her husband's intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.407, code:end</div></i>

She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister's permission.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, Crime and Punishment, distance:0.401, code:end</div></i>

But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.400, code:end</div></i>

She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

She mentioned several persons of note, who basked in the sunshine of power and fortune, without having enjoyed the least hereditary assistance from their forefathers.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.396, code:end</div></i>

She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.392, code:end</div></i>

She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.<i><div align='right'>Austen, Jane, Pride and Prejudice, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

She had no presentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over her future action had relation to anything else than his work.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.386, code:end</div></i>

She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.385, code:end</div></i>

In her mother's household she made her sisters miserable, but she did not lord it over them as she had done before.<i><div align='right'>Mead, Margaret, Coming of age in Samoa : $b A psychological study of primitive youth for western civilisation, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

Intent on her own ends, she was not enthusiastic about all this labour and was also unenthusiastic about most of her relatives.<i><div align='right'>Mead, Margaret, Coming of age in Samoa : $b A psychological study of primitive youth for western civilisation, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

She had a good head for business, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune.<i><div align='right'>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, The Brothers Karamazov, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

Thus qualified, she, in an evil hour, had recourse to the advice of our adventurer, for some ailment under which she had long laboured, and found such relief from his skill as very much prepossessed her in his favour.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T.

She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.391, code:end</div></i>

Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either foul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected by the great affairs of the world.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.371, code:end</div></i>

Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.362, code:end</div></i>

Although this kind proffer was some alleviation of her misfortunes, she did not fail to pour forth a most piteous lamentation, importing that she had not only lost all her money, amounting to five pounds, but also her letter of recommendation, upon which she had altogether relied for present employment.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T.

She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.<i><div align='right'>Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus, distance:0.389, code:end</div></i>

Perhaps she was conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she might give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the guilt of that repressed desire.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.384, code:end</div></i>

Free herself from every vestige of it, she was so entirely unreserved, so completely expansive, that soon Scrap, almost before she knew what she was doing, was being unreserved too.<i><div align='right'>Von Arnim, Elizabeth, The Enchanted April, distance:0.377, code:end</div></i>

This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.<i><div align='right'>Forster, E.

He considered this poor girl as one whose happiness or misery he had caused to be dependent on himself.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.376, code:end</div></i>

This solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.372, code:end</div></i>

With him she lived without reproach, but not without pain, in a state of great self-denial, for about twelve years; and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very rich.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.367, code:end</div></i>

In her home anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her.<i><div align='right'>Joyce, James, Dubliners, distance:0.354, code:end</div></i>

She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate.<i><div align='right'>Twain, Mark, The Prince and the Pauper, distance:0.350, code:end</div></i>

Think no unfair evil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or mercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something necessary which other people would always provide.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.341, code:end</div></i>

She saw that money conferred power, money and power, therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved more than life.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.326, code:end</div></i>

She knew herself in a strange place, destitute of all resource but in his generosity.<i><div align='right'>Smollett, T. (Tobias), The Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom — Complete, distance:0.424, code:end</div></i>

Into this soul-hunger as yet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her was one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own ignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide who would take her along the grandest path.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift, and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.414, code:end</div></i>

To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could refrain from helping the poor.<i><div align='right'>Tolstoy, Leo, graf, War and Peace, distance:0.410, code:end</div></i>

And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home.<i><div align='right'>Grimm, Jacob, Grimm, Wilhelm, Grimms' Fairy Tales, distance:0.407, code:end</div></i>

It was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome.<i><div align='right'>Dumas, Alexandre, Maquet, Auguste, The Count of Monte Cristo, distance:0.406, code:end</div></i>

As she said, she was ‘fond of luxury', and her chief trouble was poverty.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.404, code:end</div></i>

That basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined for the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so spontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had been a pleasant vice that she was addicted to.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.403, code:end</div></i>

This afternoon the helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could be dear to her, and to whom she could be dear.<i><div align='right'>Eliot, George, Middlemarch, distance:0.402, code:end</div></i>

Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her.<i><div align='right'>Alcott, Louisa May, Little Women, distance:0.360, code:end</div></i>

The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succor them.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.348, code:end</div></i>

None so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty; even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch's robe.<i><div align='right'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter, distance:0.446, code:end</div></i>

It was then resolved that she should pack up some linen and a night-gown for Sophia, with her own things; and as for all her other clothes, the young lady abandoned them with no more remorse than the sailor feels when he throws over the goods of others, in order to save his own life.<i><div align='right'>Fielding, Henry, History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, distance:0.400, code:end</div></i>
